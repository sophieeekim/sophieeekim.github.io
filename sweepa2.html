			<div class="content-text">
                <p> Design end-to-end mobile app experience based on the UX research and concept design from the past project called Sweepa.</p>
				<p><span class="emphasize">Sweepa is an indoor waste monitoring system that aims to increase convenience and work efficiency of cleaning staff by measuring the fill-level of trash cans and visualizing the data.</span>
                </p>
                <p>Sweepa, back in 2016, was an UX research project in which we conducted exploratory research and suggested a design solution based on the pain points of the existing cleaning work routine. We investigated how the current cleaning system is operated in indoor spaces and under what circumstances cleaning staff have during their work. We interviewed 4 cleaning staff members at International Yonsei University Campus, Korea. We analyzed the interview and came up with hardware and software solution for the pain points we identified. We designed a trashcan that can measure the fill-level of the garbage inside using the depth sensor. Also, we designed a realtime visual map that illustrates the current status of the trashcans. We evaluated our design concept with high-fidelity prototype focusing on hardware and software implementation.</p>
				<p>On this redesign project, I would like to focus more on ideating new features that enhance overall design and creating end-to-end mobile app experience based on previous user study and test. </p>

			<div class="content-text">	
                <p>On the previous study, there were 4 design requirements we identified from analyzing the user interviews - <span class="emphasize">1) support efficient work routine, 2) make user interface simple and intuitive, 3) provide hardware customization, 4) enable human resource management through database. </span> On this project, I would like to focus on 1), 2) and 4) which are software design requirements and create a mobile application solution that guides the users to complete their tasks successfully.</p>
            </div>  
            <div class="grid-three">
                <div>
                    <h4>Support efficient work routine</h4>
			        <p>Majority of the cleaning staffs feel inefficient to travel to designated areas and check all the trashcans when a lot of the times many of the trashcans are almost empty. 
                       Sweepa notifies the status of the trashcans to cleaning staff. The status of the trashcans indicates the real time fill level of them. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Make user interface simple and intuitive</i>
                    <p>User study found that almost all of the cleaning staff are between the age of 50 and 60. Typically, individuals in this age group have a farsightedness due to limited physical capability and have a slower adoption and learning curve of smart devices. Thus, the user interface of the system should be simplified to its essential functions only and if the application required user input, instructions should be made clear on the screen itself. </p>
                 </div>
				<div>
				<h4>Enable human resource management through database</h4>
				<p>Each cleaning staff has different amount of workload depending on the locations of their designated areas. There are some areas that the trash fills up much quickly than other areas and one of the interviewees felt unfair to see some of cleaning staff who work less than her. 
                    Therefore, there should be a way to identify those issues through database or report system. </p>

                <p> Before starting their work, user opens the Sweepa app. User is able to see their tasks of the day and confirm. Then, user can personalize their route based on their tasks and the status of the trashcans. User can select the fill-level range of the trashcans. If user select 100% to 50%, the route will be optimized with trashcans that have been filled more than 50%. </p>

                <p>Once user start their work, Sweep navigates the user to the next task. It provides the user with indoor and outdoor map, illustrating where the trashcans are located and how much it is filled. Color of the trashcans represents different range of fill-levels. (green: 0% to 25% fill-level, yellow: 25% -75% fill-level, red: 75%-100% fill-level)</p>
                <p>After completing each task, user gets immediate visual feedback on the map and status updates on their task. After the work, user is able to see the summary of their achievements and records they accomplished today.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="content-text">
            <h4 class="sub-title">User Testing</h4>
            <p>I conducted a usability test with 5 participants. <span class="emphasize"> goal of the test was to see 1) if user understands each feature and 2) if user is able to navigate from one screen to another with given scenarios.</span> I asked participants to walk through the app with 4 different scenarios. Participants were told to think out loud. During each scenario, I asked additional questions to see how much participants understand the concept of each feature. After the test, I asked what they want to do if they are given a magic wand which can create anything on this app. </p>
            <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p>All 5 participants were able to walk through the app without any difficulty. However, there were some valuable feedbacks about how to improve the app. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="emphasize">1) Finding people who are near user to request help</span>
                <br>Participant B said "Can I see where my co-workers are? Or what tasks they are doing? I don't want to bother them if they are too far or busy."
            </p>
            <p><span class="emphasize">2) Categorizing the issue when user submits a report</span>
                <br>Participant A said "If I were a manager, I would like to see the categories such as over workload or maintenance so that I can easily resolve the issue or use them as reference later."</p>
            </p>
            <h3>Design Changes</h3>
            <p>Based on the feedback from user testing, I made design changes on message tab and 'Report an issue' screen.</p>
