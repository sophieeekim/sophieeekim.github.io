				<p><a href="https://www.alice.org/">Alice</a>, who was our client of the project, asked us to create a game making tool for middle and high school students who have no experience of game design and programming. Also, our client wanted to use this tool in school curriculum for computer science teachers. </p>
				<p>We chose 2D adventure game genre for this tool, because of these following reasons: 1) Adventure games are <span class="o-b">simple to teach basic game design process.</span> 2) Adventure game mechanics <span class="o-b">align well with programming patterns.</span> 3) There is <span class="o-b">no really good novice adventure game authoring platforms.</span></p>
				<p>Our deliverable is standalone 2D cross-platform application that can be used in both home and classroom settings.</p>

			<div class="content-text">
				
				<p>Before designing our solution, we conducted survey and interviews with middle and high school students in order to better understand our target audience. The goal was <span class="o-b"> 1) to find what kind of game/app interface they are familiar with</span> and <span class="o-b">2) to see how they solve the problem in adventure game.</span> </p>

				<p><i>Survey & Observation</i></p><p>We conducted the survey at "Engineer the Future" event at the Carnegie Science Center. We met <span class="o-b">49 kids from 10 to 19 years old.</span> We gave them questionnaire to fill out and we observed them while they were playing adventure game example we provided. </p>

				

				<p><i>Interview</i></p><p>
				We invited a <span class="o-b">few students and teachers from Cornell School</span> to our project room and we conducted a semi-structured interview with them. We talked about what kind of games and tools they use on their school computers, and what kind of challenges they faced in computer science education.

			<div class="content-text">	
				<p>We created personas and user journey map based on what we found in user research. We tried to create a persona that represents how middle and high school students behave and react to our tool. We assumed that our tool is similiar to current existing block-coding tools.</p>

				<p><i>Key Findings</i></p>
				<p><b>1)</b>  Current <span class="o-b">existing block-coding tools are too difficult</span> for students who have no programming experience. Students have hard time to convert their thoughts into programming-like logic. <br> <b>2)</b>  Students are <span class="o-b">not familiar with adventure game concept.</span> They enjoy playing adventure games, but they are not aware of what makes the adventure game from game design perspective. </p>


				<h4 class="sub-title"><span>Design & Prototype</span></h4>
				<p><i>Studying Adventure Games</i></p>
				<p>Before designing an adventure game making tool, we had to be an expert in adventure game. We played a lot of adventure games and tried out various kinds of game making tools. Then, we started to create our own adventure games which we want the students to make from our tools. </p>

				<p>This is a simple adventure game we made using our own API. This game includes all the <span class="o-b" >basic game design components of an adventure game. </span> The game is called "Feed the cat". Player has to collect a piece of bread, a knife, and a jam in inventory. Then, the player has to combine those items in a right order. Finally the player has to navigate to the right room and feed the cat. </p>

				<p><i>Paper Prototype</i></p>
				<p>We used paper prototype to refine our design idea. First, we made each component of user interface into paper. Then, we pretended to be the middle school students and tried to make three different kinds of adventure games with the prototype. </p>
				<p><i>Key Findings</i></p>
				<p><b>1)</b> We found that the language we use in the interface is <span class="o-b">too technical for teenagers</span> (it was more like a tool programmers use). <br><b>2)</b> There was no design guidance in the tool. The tool was giving too much freedom to students, which makes it too difficult for them to start designing a game. In other words, the tool <span class="o-b">wasn't teaching the design process </span></p>

			<div class="content-text">
				<p>Based on the findings from paper prototype, we came up with <span class="o-b">this list of words that can be used in adventure game design. </span> We divided these words in three categories - event, state, and reaction. This classification can lead students to think about how to make a game based on the three steps. It gives <span class="o-b">more guidance to students.</span> Also, the three steps <span class="o-b">align well with the programming patterns</span> as well. Event can represent the condition. State can represent a variable. Reaction indicates the result of if-statement. </p>

				<p><i>Wireframe</i></p>
				<p>After making changes in our design, we built a wireframe in order to test our new design. In new design, 1)<span class="o-b">We discarded sandbox-style interface, and introduced step-by-step interface</span> which gives more guidance to students. 2) We discarded block-coding (object-driven coding). Instead, we introduced <span class="o-b">global-driven interactions.</span></p>

					<p><i>Playtesting Day at ETC</i></p>
					<p>We had 3 batches of varying number of playtesters, all of whom were teenagers.  The kids’ reactions to the tool were promising; they grasped the concept of adventure games well enough and they instinctively knew how the scene editor and the interaction boxes worked (However, it has to be noted that a few of them had seen and used tools and programs like this before). We learnt a lot about positioning our buttons and boxes in the User Interface.</p>

					<p><i>Community Center at Johnston Public School</i></p>
				<p>On week 13, we conducted a play testing session at the community center located at Johnston Public School. On arrival at the venue, there was an unforeseen problem because all the computers in use were Linux systems, and our program is made only for Windows & Mac OS. Luckily we had a few spare laptops, but the numbers of students still outnumbered the number of computers available. But we used this to our advantage as we paired up the kids on one system.</p>
